# Overview

I am a huge LEGO fan and have spent a non-trivial amount of money purchasing LEGO sets that I find interesting. Being such a fan, a common thing that I hear is that people find purchasing LEGO to be expensive. Following on, people also believe that LEGO has gotten more expensive in recent times.

For quite some time I have been meaning to delve into available data on the cost of LEGO sets to explore whether it is in fact getting more expensive. Finally I have gotten around to it.

On this page, I will explore this question and a few others regarding the cost of LEGO. Namely;

- **Has LEGO gotten more expensive over time?**
- **Is their a premium paid on licensed sets (e.g. Star Wars) over unlicensed sets (e.g. Ninjago)?**
- **Is it cheap or expensive to purchase LEGO in Australia compared to elsewhere?**

For those not overly interested in the deep-dive, the **TL;DR** of these questions are;
- Yes and No. Individual metrics commonly used such as cost per piece or cost per gram are fairly stable over time. However, the median size of sets has been increasing (larger and more detailed), leading to higher retail prices.
- Yes!
- Relatively speaking yes, although it is cheaper in some US states.

For those interested in the details, this analysis is broken into the following:

- [Has LEGO gotten more expensive?](#time-analysis)
- [Are licensed sets more expensive?](#licensed-unlicensed)
- [Is LEGO expensive in Australia?](#cost-in-Australia)
